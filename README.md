# Boardpad - Frontend

An `Angular 13` application that consists in a fast and non bureaucratic task management using a `Kanban` view.

All the CRUD tasks is been doing by a `Restfull Spring Boot Java Application` found at [BoardPad-Back](https://github.com/Wett-Brito/BoardPad-Back).

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Or you can run command ng serve --o and the terminal will start your browser in the correct url automatically.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
